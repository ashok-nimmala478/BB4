## 📌 Abstract
Accurate identification of diseases from medical images is critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment. Manual interpretation of high-resolution 3D medical images is time-consuming and prone to variability among clinicians.This project proposes TransAugNet, a deep learning framework based on a ResNet3D-50 architecture for automated disease classification from volumetric medical images. The model converts 3D image volumes into stacked 2D slices, enabling efficient feature extraction and improved disease classification accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate faster response time and reliable performance compared to traditional medical image analysis approaches.
